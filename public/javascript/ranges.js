However, don't give up on one another just yet-differences are sometimes the key to a successful and healthy relationship, as you two may balance one another out well.  You'll always miss 100% of the shots you don't take, so go ahead and give this relationship a shot."

The bad news is that you are more different than you are similar when it comes to your personalities and characteristics.  However, even though you will drive each other crazy at times, you'll enjoy the challenge, while also learning to accept and embrace your individual differences. If you're willing to put forth the effort, then you'll have a rewarding life filled with excitement and happiness."

The two of you are clearly unalike in almost every way, but who are we to tell you that you aren't meant to be?  Though you may have a bumpy road ahead, no one ever said love was going to be easy...however, once you find the one you're meant to be with, it will be worth it in the long run."
